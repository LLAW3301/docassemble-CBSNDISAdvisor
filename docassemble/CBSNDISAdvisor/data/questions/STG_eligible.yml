  Thank you for answering our questions.
  
  From what you have told us, you have a level of autism spectrum disorder
  that might mean you can get support under the NDIS. 
  
  To be eligible for the NDIS your autism spectrum disorder **must** cause you a 
  very high level of difficulty in *one* of the following areas:
    
    - Communication
    - Social interaction
    - Learning
    - Mobility
    - Self-care
    - Self-management

  According to **section 24** of the [*National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013* (Cth)](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2013A00020)
  your level of impairment may mean you are eligible.
  
  You can apply to the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) in order to get
  support. You can do this by calling the NDIA on 1800 800 119.
  
  Please keep in mind that the NDIA makes the final decision about who gets to
  receive support under the NDIS. The NDIA may not think you are eligible, and you
  should be prepared for this.
