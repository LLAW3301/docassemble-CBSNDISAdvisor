  You can apply to the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) in order to get
  support. You can do this by calling the NDIA on 1800 800 119.
  
  Please keep in mind that the NDIA makes the final decision about who gets to
  receive support under the NDIS. The NDIA may not think you are eligible, and you
  should be prepared for this.
