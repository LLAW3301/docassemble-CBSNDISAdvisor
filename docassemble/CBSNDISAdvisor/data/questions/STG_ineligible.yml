  According to **section 24** of the [*National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013* (Cth)](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2013A00020)
  your answers indicate that you do not meet this requirement.
  
  **This means you may not be eligible to access the NDIS.**
  
  The National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) makes the final decision
  about who gets to receive support under the NDIS. They might think that 
  you are eligible to get support. If you would like to contact them to discuss 
  your eligibility you can do this by calling them on 1800 800 119.
