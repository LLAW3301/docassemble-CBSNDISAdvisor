question: Eligibility requirements not met
subquestion: |

  **Unfortunately, you are *not* eligible for the NDIS.**
  
  
  
  To access the NDIS, you must be between 7 and 65 years old. You must also live
  in Australia and be either an Australian citizen or holder of a protected or
  special category Visa.
  
  
  
  **Based on what you told us, you do not meet one of these requirements, therefore
  you are unable to access the NDIS.**
