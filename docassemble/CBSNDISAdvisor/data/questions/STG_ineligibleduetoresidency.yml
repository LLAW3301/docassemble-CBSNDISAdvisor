question: Eligibility requirements not met
subquestion: |

  **Unfortunately, you are *not* eligible for the NDIS.**
 
 
  
  To access the NDIS, you must be between 7 and 65 years old. 
  
  You must also live in Australia and be either an 
  Australian citizen or holder of a protected or special category Visa.
  
  For the purposes of this questionnaire, you must also have autism spectrum
  disorder, or believe you might, for us to be able to determine whether you 
  are eligible.
  
  
  **Based on what you told us, you do not meet one of these requirements, therefore
  you are unable to access the NDIS.**
