subquestion: |
  ** Your answers indicate that you are not seeking funding from the NDIS for 
  autism spectrum disorder.**
 
  If you have a different disability and would like to check if you 
  are eligible then you should contact the National Disability Insurance Agency 
  (NDIA) and make an Access Request with them. You can make this request 
  by calling the NDIA on 1800 800 119.
